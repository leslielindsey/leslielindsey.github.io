I joined GW's eDesign Shop after several years of instructional design and faculty development experience at The University of Texas at Tyler, Manhattanville College, and my alma mater, Texas Woman's University, where I also worked as a graduate student in the Pioneers Oral History Project and taught United States history. My research interests include discussion and interaction, the history of technology, and critical pedagogies.

## Current Projects:

- developing new online courses for the GW School of Business
- higher education in rural communities
- GIS and data mapping
